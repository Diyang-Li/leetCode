2. How to find the medium value by using priority queue?  295
3. 438 can use int[] to record the frequency of each char in window, count to record the nums of valid char in window
    not recommand map, because the int[] is faster, the len of sliding window is fixed. For 395, we need to use map,
    because the length of window is not fixed

Template:
Some hard problem like 395, we need to find a sliding window

Can use other method:
