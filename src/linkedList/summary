dummy:
1. 86: we use p2(the node next to the head to compare with the target),if don't use dummy, we will ignore the
    comparison between the fist node and target value;

2. 23, 148: Divide and Conquer + 21:Merge Two Sorted List, integrate two questions

3. 234: provide a method to find middle of linkedlist:
        When finding the middle, there is a tricky part!!
              a. if 1 2 3 4 mid = 3: slow = head, fast = head
              b. if 1 2 3 4 mid = 2: slow = head, fast = head.next
              c. if 1 2 3 4 5 mid = 3, slow = head, fast = head/head.next
      Also, when using the reverse linkedlist, we have to consider if the head can be null in the base case;

4. 345: provide a better way to move one pointer, until find the target one, then remove another


key template:
1. fast and slow pointer
2. merge two linked list
3. consider dummy

//当需要考虑first node的改变的时候，可以考虑使用dummy 如 19 86
