dummy:
1. 86: we use p2(the node next to the head to compare with the target),if don't use dummy, we will ignore the
    comparison between the fist node and target value;

2. 23: Divide and Conquer + 21:Merge Two Sorted List, integrate two questions

3. 234: provide a method to find middle of linkedlist: fast and slow pointer, fast = head.next, slow = head
      Also, when using the reverse linkedlist, we have to consider if the head can be null in the base case;

some questions needs primary:
